## Overview

This project involved building a full-stack IoT monitoring system,
from hardware sensing nodes to a web-based analytics dashboard.

The objective was to design a scalable architecture capable of
real-time data transmission and visualization.

## System Architecture

The system consisted of:

- ESP32-based sensing nodes  
- MQTT protocol for lightweight communication  
- A Node.js backend  
- A web dashboard for real-time visualization

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. MQTT for Communication

MQTT was chosen due to:

- Low bandwidth requirements  
- Publish-subscribe flexibility  
- Efficient handling of multiple devices  

### 2. Real-Time Updates

WebSockets were integrated to push live updates to the dashboard
without manual refresh.

### 3. Edge Filtering

Basic preprocessing was performed at the device level to reduce
network load and improve responsiveness.

## Results

The system successfully:

- Supported multiple device streams  
- Reduced latency using event-driven updates  
- Provided intuitive visualizations for end users  

## What I Would Improve

- Add anomaly detection using lightweight ML  
- Improve authentication mechanisms  
- Optimize data persistence for long-term analytics
