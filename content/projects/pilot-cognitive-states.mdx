## Project Objective

(The post is incomplete and unstructured.)

Utilize machine learning to classify different attentive states of pilots based on physiological signals during simulated flights

Source: https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/flight-crew-physiological-data-for-crew-state-monitoring 
NASA’s Flight Crew Physiological Data for Crew State Monitoring
18 pilots (10 clean sets were filtered out)

Controlled Experiments (3 classes)
- Channelized Attention (CA)
- Diverted Attention (DA)
- Startle/Surprise (SS)
- Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT)

Sensors (23 Attributes)
- 20 EEG channels, ECG (heart), GSR (skin response), R (respiration)
- Captured using NeXus-10 system

Dataset complexity ‼ 
- 23 features, time-series data, subtle feature variations, noise data, and high overlap between classes, large dataset


Visualization of the dataset. The dataset was a time series data of noisy biological signals

The dataset distribution was highly imbalanced

Dataset was large. needed preprocessing. we using rolling and moving average for sampling.

Adaboost was accurate but slower. We tested with decision tree. We propose a cascading model for imbalanced data.
