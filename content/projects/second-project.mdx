## Overview

This project explores the design of a structured neural network architecture
for signal reconstruction under noisy channel conditions.

Instead of using a fully unconstrained deep network, I imposed a DCT-based
structure on the model to enforce interpretability and mathematical alignment
with classical signal processing theory.

## Problem

Traditional neural networks can approximate signal reconstruction tasks,
but they often:

- Lack interpretability  
- Require excessive parameters  
- Fail under distribution shift  

The goal was to design a model that preserves mathematical structure
while remaining learnable.

## Approach

The architecture was designed with:

- A DCT-II transformation layer  
- A learnable diagonal scaling matrix  
- A DCT-III reconstruction layer  

This mimics classical transform-domain filtering while allowing
trainable adaptability.

The network was trained to minimize reconstruction error under simulated
channel perturbations.

## Results

The structured model:

- Converged faster than an equivalent dense model  
- Required fewer parameters  
- Demonstrated improved stability under noisy conditions  

## Lessons Learned

Mathematical structure does not restrict neural networks.
It can enhance stability and interpretability when aligned properly
with domain knowledge.

## Future Work

- Extend to complex-valued inputs  
- Explore FFT-based structured layers  
- Deploy in edge-computing environments
