## A Small Reflection

It was a small pause between my thoughts. A late night. I had just finished watching one of the most beautifully unsettling films. 
Another post for another day. I felt the urge to share with someone what I saw, my view, my opinion. Why? Because you don't just 
see with your eyes and hear with your ears. You feel and experience a work of art with all your senses. You absorb it. You carry it.
Suddenly, it occured to me all at once. "I should start a Blog!".

I have been thinking about building a professional portfolio for a while. Something polished. Something presentable. 
But what is a professional life without a bit of creativity and a pocket of curiosity? Yes! That is what I want my blog to exactly be. 
A human. A refelction. An imperfection. A gentle confession. A humble revelation. A perfect balance.

## What's Next

I will write! I will write about what moves me. A movie that keeps me up at night. I will write about what keeps me busy. 
A paper that shifts my thinking. A project that stretches me. A question that lingers longer than it should. This space will grow as I grow. 
I will keep noticing the most amazing things in the world, and I will keep writing. See you soon.
