## Capturing Thoughts Before They Disappear

Ideas are fragile.

Sometimes I understand something clearly in my head,
and two days later it becomes vague.

Writing forces clarity.

## Writing as Thinking

When I write, I notice:

- Gaps in logic  
- Weak arguments  
- Unclear transitions  

The act of explaining something often reveals what I do not yet understand.

## This Space

This blog is not about perfection.

It is about iteration.

Some posts will be technical.
Some will be reflective.
Some will just be small notes.

That is fine.
