## I will write soon
A bee brain has less than 1 million neurons. Humans have ~86 billion. 
\Yet bees can still tell apart from flowers, hive matter, spatial patterns, and even human faces! 
Yes. surprisingly, honey bees can recognize human faces. I don't want to mislead you by stating that 
recognizing faces as something that bees naturally care about. In the wild, this could not be a surprising outcome. 
However, experiments done in labs have trained bees to associate a specific human face image with a sugar reward. After training, the bees could, 
1. Pick the correct face from several options, 2. Generalize across slightly altered versions of the same face. Isn't that interesting? 

The conclusion is that honey bees don’t just memorize pixels but they process configurations of features (eyes, nose, mouth relationships), 
similar to how humans do. Or if I deviate the topic a little bit, doesn't that sound a bit like how a Neural Network is trained under the "black box".  
I love how nature often inspires technology! 🐝🤖
