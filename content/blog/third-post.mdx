## The Appeal of Structure

In many machine learning systems, we allow models to learn freely. 
But sometimes, adding structure improves both interpretability and stability.

When we impose mathematical structure, we are not limiting the model.
We are guiding it.

## Why I Prefer Structured Models

A structured model often:

- Requires fewer parameters  
- Converges more predictably  
- Aligns better with domain knowledge  

In engineering, we rarely design blindly. 
Why should learning systems be different?

## Final Thought

Freedom is powerful.  
Constraint is powerful too.  
The balance between them is where interesting design happens.
