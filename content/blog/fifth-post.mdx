## Low Expectations, High Impact

I started this movie casually.

No research.
No hype.
No reviews.

And that may have been the best way to watch it.

## What Worked

The pacing felt intentional.
The soundtrack carried emotion without overpowering scenes.
The silence between dialogues mattered.

## A Small Lesson

Sometimes we overanalyze before experiencing.

Maybe the better approach is:
Watch first.
Think later.
